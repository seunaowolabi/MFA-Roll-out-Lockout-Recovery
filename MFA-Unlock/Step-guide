Purpose

This guide explains what to do if you lose access to your Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) device for the AWS Management Console.
Following these steps helps protect your account while restoring secure access.

⚠️ When to Use This Guide

Use this procedure if:

You lost your phone or Authenticator app

Your device was wiped or replaced

Your MFA token stopped working

You deleted your AWS Authenticator entry by accident

🪜 Recovery Steps
Step 1 — Do Not Try Multiple Logins

Avoid repeated login attempts — this may trigger a temporary lockout.
Instead, proceed with the recovery process below.

Step 2 — Notify IT or Account Administrator

Contact your AWS administrator or IT support team as soon as possible.

Provide:

Your AWS username or email address

Your account ID or account alias

The reason you can’t complete MFA (e.g., lost device, new phone)

Example message:

“Hi team, I lost access to my MFA device and can’t log in to the AWS console.
My username is jane.doe@company.com
. Please reset my MFA.”

Step 3 — Admin Verification (IT Action)

The IT admin will:

Verify your identity (by manager confirmation, email check, or ID verification).

Log in to the AWS console as an admin.

Go to
IAM → Users → [YourUsername] → Security credentials → Manage MFA

Click Remove MFA device to unlink your old authenticator.

✅ Screenshot to take for documentation:
“IAM → Security credentials → Remove MFA device” confirmation page.

Step 4 — Re-Register MFA

Once notified by IT that your old MFA device is removed:

Log in to the AWS console with your username and password.

You’ll be prompted to set up MFA again.

Choose Virtual MFA device.

Open your new Authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator).

Scan the QR code displayed on the AWS console.

Enter the two consecutive 6-digit codes.

Click Assign MFA.

✅ You’ll see confirmation:

“Virtual MFA device successfully assigned.”

Step 5 — Test Login

Sign out, then sign back in using your new MFA device to confirm everything works correctly.
